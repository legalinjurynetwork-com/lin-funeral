                In order to connect you with quality legal services pertaining to your claims or injuries, we collect and share certain information from you. You can learn more about our privacy and data handling practices in our Privacy Policy and our Privacy Notice for California residents and Nevada consumers.
                California residents and Nevada consumers have the right to request access to the data we collect on you, and they may request that we no longer sell such data to our partners or that we delete any data we have relating to them. If you are a California resident or Nevada consumer and would like to learn more about or exercise any of these rights, please either 1) call us at (866) 210-2410 and follow the prompts, or 2) email us.
                <br>

                Only you, or a person registered with the relevant state’s Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.

                We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to an additional 90 days if you are a California resident, or an additional 45 days if you are a Nevada consumer), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
